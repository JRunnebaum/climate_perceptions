They follow patterns which include spawning and foraging.      For lobsters, the urge to spawn is great when they follow the slight rising temperature changes.  In the Spring, when they detect changes in water temperature, the females head inshore to molt.  After the females molt, the hard-shelled males show up to spawn.  The females harden up a bit, then it's time for the males to molt.  It is (was) almost predictable.      Now the soft females are fodder for the predators.  They arrive at about the same time as the males, Stripers & Dogs gorge them selves on the easy pickins.      Well, guess what, the same lobster cannot be caught twice.  If it's fish food, it won't get to the human's table, will it?  Oh, well maybe indirectly, Stripers are good to eat (for humans), right?",That remains to be seen.

They say the test tows they rely on for the data have to be done in the same place and at the same time of year which is all good for a scientific stand point I get an experiment has to be as close to control as possible but that doesn’t work for fish they have tails and move there following food sources and currents. If you took a golf coarse and gridded it off and only sampled a section that had a sand trap on it then by all rights the whole coarse is a desert. The science and the way it is done needs to change.

In my area, fishermen are running to the end of federal area 1, and catching more lobsters than ever before. I fill in the area they once fished, and we have done extremely well too. The overall catch has increased in the last 39 years. I think part of that is because more fishermen are leaving traps out, and baiting them weekly, which keeps the lobsters more active. In addition, fishermen have self regulated by  punching  breeding females so they can't be harvested. We have successfully cultivated our own fishery, and as a result are seeing more pounds sold, and a larger overall population than ever before. We're seeing short lobsters with eggs on them, that wasn't happening 30 years ago. I believe lobstering will continue to thrive.",no,NA,"I don't feel that climate change is happening at the rate that has been reported. I've seen populations run a cyclical pattern, where species thrive and then decline over time based on food, habitat, and harvest. 20 years ago we could see bare ledge in shallow water, that bottom is now covered in kelp. Not because of changing water temperature, but because sea urchins aren't there to eat the kelp. Rabbit population directly relates to coyote population. I realize that isn't the ocean, but it appears to me that these changes aren't based on major global climate change, but many factors. I do agree that we have seen minimal local changes in the world. I don't feel like there has been nearly enough research of information provided to give conclusive evidence that climate change is going to make major changes like AL Gore predicted.","There are species moving from the southern warmer waters, to northern waters such as menhaden. We haven't seen  pogies  in this area that I know of at any point. The last 2 years we have seen more.

We have not seen 60 degree water here for the last 3 years.",yes,"With the collapse of the groundfish in the 1980 s lobster populations increased, The groundfish fleet was gutted.Landinds took huge drops because there was no boats left fishing. Lobstering became the only profitable fishery that was left. There was alot of lobsters to fish on. Alot of people got into the fishery. Maine used to have a huge small boat fleet for groundfish, gill netters and draggers.The govt totally mismanaged the fishery, and most small boats lost thier permits. Lobster was the only show in town.",yes,"Lobsters start to trap after shedding earlier than they used to. Used to be mid July, now they are trapping by the 4th inshore. Lobsters trap almost year round now, where they used to numb up when the water got cold in February. I should go back and state  that the ocean temp has moderated year round ,so I guess it could be considered to be warming , but I would call it a moderation, with a more steady water temp.","There is still a lobster fishery down in Rhode Island, and Southern New England with 70 degree water, so we have a way to go up here to see that. The scallops in Southern New England, and east Coast in General seem to be doing fine. There is alot of groundfish in the Gulf Of Maine, but you wont hear that from any Govt agency, and we will never get our permits back. The big players will own that industry, and ll the on shore infrastructure is gone, so my guess there will be factory ships when fishing is allowed.It seems like mussels dont like the chenicals coming out od sewer treatment plants, or lawn fertilizer, because the y dont seem to be around the shore anymore, but seem to grow fine on ropes or floats.","Herring and menhaden, seem to be thriving, and mackerel. The scallops in the southern east coast are doing fine, so that may be true here. One thing I have learned over my years is that every year things change. The ocean is always changing. Species come and go with the years. There is good years and bad, There are shrimp here in the winter, but no fishery. Govt doesnt like to trust what fishermen tell them. It never seems to fit their agenda I guess.
