They follow patterns which include spawning and foraging.      For lobsters, the urge to spawn is great when they follow the slight rising temperature changes.  In the Spring, when they detect changes in water temperature, the females head inshore to molt.  After the females molt, the hard-shelled males show up to spawn.  The females harden up a bit, then it's time for the males to molt.  It is (was) almost predictable.      Now the soft females are fodder for the predators.  They arrive at about the same time as the males, Stripers & Dogs gorge them selves on the easy pickins.      Well, guess what, the same lobster cannot be caught twice.

As a young, female captain, vessel owner, and now commercial license holder, I do not feel like I  have a voice in decisions that affect me and my future.","If we view coastal and marine fisheries as complex social-ecological systems and/or see the blue economy as overarching social, environmental, and economic targets, we need metrics that touch upon each of these dimensions.  Metrics that are most lacking fall in the social realm, including issues related to access, equity, and distribution of benefits in fisheries.","Licensed commercial fishermen speak for licensed commercial fishermen only, not “fishing communities” as a whole. Licensed commercial fishermen in federally-managed groundfisheries represent an even smaller number and less diverse grouping of participants. Fishing communities are comprised of a diversity of actors--  members of fishing families, participants across the entire fisheries value chain, those involved in ancillary, dockside services, and seafood consumers. In surveys like this, the perspectives of women, youth, minorities (foreign-born workers and immigrants), and indigenous people are excluded while the voices and needs of the most privileged and powerful, predominantly older white males within fishing communities are magnified.  A majority of participants in fisheries and members of fishing communities-- including the most vulnerable and adaptable-- are left out of surveys that simply poll licensed commercial fishermen.      For example, the tribal women and children who lost their commercial licenses because they are “not residents of Maine” won’t be able to share their thoughts. My friend B, a Cambodian refugee who runs a fishing fleet (formerly out of Portland, now out of Gloucester), will not be able to respond because while he may land over $1 million USD in fish a year, he does not read or write in English. You will not get a response from the people who pick and process shellfish, groundfish, and lobster. Nor will you hear from the wives of fishermen who are staying home to provide childcare and sell products direct to customers this summer due to the covid-19 outbreak. The unlicensed crew, deckhands, and sternmen won’t be able to respond.  And what about people who sell bait, run the wharves, run the seafood restaurants and markets, make the gear, fix the boats? What about the Asian women who fish for periwinkles and mackerel?  The unlicensed women and children who work onboard to cull and shuck shellfish?  Fish are a public resource and I am of the opinion that non-licensed community members also have a right to resources in the form of accessible, affordable, and nutritious seafood.  Do they also have a say in how we respond and adapt to climate change?      I completed this survey and shared my thoughts, but I sincerely hope it is not used for decision making purposes without the explicit acknowledgement that survey results only reflect the knowledge and opinions of a very small percentage of individuals situated within fishing communities.",2,"uszvccx1jw7cvzwk","ORJYodytWF","07/22/2020 05:11"

In my area, fishermen are running to the end of federal area 1, and catching more lobsters than ever before. I fill in the area they once fished, and we have done extremely well too. The overall catch has increased in the last 39 years. I think part of that is because more fishermen are leaving traps out, and baiting them weekly, which keeps the lobsters more active. In addition, fishermen have self regulated by  punching  breeding females so they can't be harvested. We have successfully cultivated our own fishery, and as a result are seeing more pounds sold, and a larger overall population than ever before.

Not because of changing water temperature, but because sea urchins aren't there to eat the kelp. Rabbit population directly relates to coyote population. I realize that isn't the ocean, but it appears to me that these changes aren't based on major global climate change, but many factors. I do agree that we have seen minimal local changes in the world.

As a young, female captain, vessel owner, and now commercial license holder, I do not feel like I  have a voice in decisions that affect me and my future.","If we view coastal and marine fisheries as complex social-ecological systems and/or see the blue economy as overarching social, environmental, and economic targets, we need metrics that touch upon each of these dimensions.  Metrics that are most lacking fall in the social realm, including issues related to access, equity, and distribution of benefits in fisheries.","Licensed commercial fishermen speak for licensed commercial fishermen only, not “fishing communities” as a whole. Licensed commercial fishermen in federally-managed groundfisheries represent an even smaller number and less diverse grouping of participants. Fishing communities are comprised of a diversity of actors--  members of fishing families, participants across the entire fisheries value chain, those involved in ancillary, dockside services, and seafood consumers. In surveys like this, the perspectives of women, youth, minorities (foreign-born workers and immigrants), and indigenous people are excluded while the voices and needs of the most privileged and powerful, predominantly older white males within fishing communities are magnified.  A majority of participants in fisheries and members of fishing communities-- including the most vulnerable and adaptable-- are left out of surveys that simply poll licensed commercial fishermen.      For example, the tribal women and children who lost their commercial licenses because they are “not residents of Maine” won’t be able to share their thoughts. My friend B, a Cambodian refugee who runs a fishing fleet (formerly out of Portland, now out of Gloucester), will not be able to respond because while he may land over $1 million USD in fish a year, he does not read or write in English. You will not get a response from the people who pick and process shellfish, groundfish, and lobster. Nor will you hear from the wives of fishermen who are staying home to provide childcare and sell products direct to customers this summer due to the covid-19 outbreak. The unlicensed crew, deckhands, and sternmen won’t be able to respond.  And what about people who sell bait, run the wharves, run the seafood restaurants and markets, make the gear, fix the boats? What about the Asian women who fish for periwinkles and mackerel?  The unlicensed women and children who work onboard to cull and shuck shellfish?  Fish are a public resource and I am of the opinion that non-licensed community members also have a right to resources in the form of accessible, affordable, and nutritious seafood.  Do they also have a say in how we respond and adapt to climate change?      I completed this survey and shared my thoughts, but I sincerely hope it is not used for decision making purposes without the explicit acknowledgement that survey results only reflect the knowledge and opinions of a very small percentage of individuals situated within fishing communities.",2,uszvccx1jw7cvzwk,ORJYodytWF,7/22/2020 5:11

Scientists need to talk with the men and women who are seeing these changes( if any) and give true facts back to the public,Bottom temperature and water salinity,I think that fishermen have been fishing for a long time and no one wants to cut their own throats. For the most part fishermen are very in tune with their surroundings and the water and don’t want to have to leave crucial fishing decisions up to people that are bias and misinformed. There are a lot of people that want to see fishing stop all together. If this ever happens the state of Maine will be totally financially crippled and many families will have nothing. This is not limited to just fishermen and women. All the coastal mom n pop stores that rely on the fishing community to spend money locally will be devastated and also sent in financial ruin.

Bluefin uses a ridiculous program of recreational fishermen interviews in place of hard data to inform the stock assessment.
