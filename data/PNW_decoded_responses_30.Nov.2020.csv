DNR has prioritized profit over sustainability. Many beds have been harvested multiple times per year, for up to 6 years in a row. Buyers push for quality, which leaves harvesters an option of high grading/poaching/off tract harvest or being fired for producing low quality product or underproducing.

I was in charge of the Fish and Wildlife Enforcement Section of the Oregon State police.  I spent 30 years working for he Oregon State police.      The management of our natural resources is more about generating money for the natural resource department than it is about managing the natural resource itself.      Our management of resources needs to be restructured so it is not so dependent upon money coming in from the sale of tags and licenses.","I am retired from the Oregon State Police where I spent several of my 30 years conducting Fish and Wildlife enforcement.  I was in charge of the Fish and Wildlife Division for 6 years.      After retiring I decided I wanted to be a commercial fisher.    I do not make enough money fishing to pay the bills at home.  I barely make enough money to pay for my fees and licenses to start over again the next year.      I will try and articulate my concerns I have noticed below.    There is very little coheshion within the fishing community.  In Garibaldi one of the wholesalers seems to have very little money to invest in their infrastructure.  They formed a business relationship with a very large wholesaler from Astoria.  The large wholesaler allows them to stay in business but they also don't allow them to go out and find new markets because that would compete with the larger wholesaler.  So in effect the local wholesaler is allowed to sell fish out of their glass case in their local store and they buy some fish for their market but the rest of the fish gets shipped to the larger wholesaler out of town.  This effects the local fisherman because the local wholesaler does not work to open up new markets.  As a fisherman I have learned the easy part is catching the fish.  The hard part is having a market.  The market limits a fisherman to catching fish only when the market allows the fisherman to sell the fish.    A big concern I think a lot about is the wholesalers want to make all the money.  The fisherman are not getting much more money for their fish than they did 20 years ago.    The ability for a wholesaler to process fish is also limiting to the fisherman.  It is becoming harder and harder for the processes to fish people who what to fillet fish.  The job doesn't pay much and is is sporadic work.    The availability of ice is held over the fisherman as to where they can deliver and sale their fish to. A processor will sell a fisherman ice but if they want the fish the fisher catches they expect to get the fish delivered to them even though the fisherman had to pay for the ice.  If the fisherman buys his ice from one processor and then wants to deliver his fish to another processor because they get a higher price the original processor who sold them the ice will refuse to sell them ice the next time the fisher wants ice.    A local processor recently started asking fisherman to sign a contract that if they deliver fish to them they must receive the entire load of fish.  The fisher is not allowed to sell a partial load of fish to another wholesaler.  This limits how a small wholesaler can break into the market and get a start.  It also eliminates the competition for the larger wholesalers.    Many of the fisherman are dependent on alcohol and this effects the way the fisherman get along with each other.    Some fisherman are strictly salmon fisherman and with no salmon to catch it leaves boats in the harbor taking up moorage space that is not being utilized.  The boats just sit there in port taking up moorage because it costs more to go fishing than they are able to sell their fish for.  This keeps the port from being as effective as possible.  Limited moorage space with boats not working keeps the port from accepting fish. The port struggles to keep derelict boats our of the port.  There is a four year waiting time to get a space.  the port implements rules like you must have at least one landing each year to keep your space.  This rule is implemented to get rid of the derelict boats but once its implemented the boats who are sitting around waiting for the salmon to come back so they can go fishing is hit with a rule telling them they don't have a landing so they have to give up their space.    I have a lot of insight or perspective because of my back ground.  If anybody finds this perspective interesting they are welcome to call me.  503-510-7996    I find it interesting that surveys and studies don't really get to the problem of what is really effecting the fisherman because the people conducting the surveys are not on the ground or don't have the knowledge they would if they were an actual fisher trying to catch and sell fish.     In my past profession as a Fish and Wildlife officer I used to investigate and serve search warrants on large wholesalers/processors.  I seen what extent the wholesalers would do to steal the fish from the fisherman to make a profit.  Often times the money taken from the fisherman would be displaced from the local community to a larger community like Portland where the wholesaler was headquartered.  Know Im a fisherman trying to figure out how to sell the fish I catch.  I have chosen to become a wholesaler and fisherman.  I catch the fish and then sell it to myself.  This process is littered with red tape and regulations.  The department of Agriculture enters the scene with a whole set of regulations that don't always match the regulations set forth by Oregon Fish and Wildlife laws.    Not very many fisherman I know would be able to interpret the regulations and manage to crawl through the red tape I have to be a fisherman that sells his fish to himself ant then sell it.","Walt Markee","waltmarkee@aol.com",1,5260.563,13,NA,11,NA,5,6,"01/02/2020 08:48",NA,NA,NA,0,"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_13_6) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/13.0.3 Safari/605.1.15","..","/survey/selfserve/5d8/191103?sampid=104041&pin=JHJN&mail=1","01qgwr1r4aknpyd2",1,104041

Seals and Sea Lions have no way of being managed and are growing at a rapid pace. People are quick to blame climate change and habitat loss when we have failed to keep the predators in check. Look at current populations of the predators and compare them to the 70's and you'll see where the real problem lies. Then same is happening with Deer and Elk populations as we have no way to control cougar/bear populations with the loss of hound hunting and wolves are spreading like wildfire with no way to keep their numbers in check. WA is being run on emotions and not based on humans being part of the chain of life. If we don't control the predators our fisheries and game populations will pay the ultimate price. Our biggest issue with crab right now is the tribes crabbing whenever they want and controlling the market price. It doesn't help that China will not buy our crab due to the trade war which further drives the price down as we primarily have to sell it locally. Tribes get 50% of quota and the local crabbers get whatever is left over from the recreational quota which is less and less as more people begin crabbing in the area and salmon fishing falls further downhill. Traded my crab boat this year for a permit so I can lease it out, looking to move to Idaho to get out of this state being continually mismanaged by Inslee and his liberal gang. So yeah, my wife and I brought in 567,000 this year and it is leaving the community. So yeah, it does have a negative impact when fisheries crumble but climate change is not the leading cause if any.",1,"Tribes have gotten 50% of quota. This leads to them starting to crab in June and filling half quota before we hit the water in Oct to which they have flooded the market with crab which drops the price right in time for our season opener. Tribes then come back on the water during holidays to take advantage of yet another high price yield. We cannot crab in the summer due to recreational crabbers and so crab masses are thinned out dramatically before our opener begins.

It's a scary political world out there and I hope one day people will put their political party agendas to the side and properly manage wildlife populations. Climate Change has been ongoing on Earth and it's nothing new. This mismanagement of our oceans predator populations is human error and can be fixed.

We have seen urchins so hungry that they eat barnacles and coralina.   The state of wa will not allow the harvest of purple sea urchin, tho we have warmed them of the potential impact of this invasive species having seen the impact they have had in Oregon and California. Every year we have seen more and more purples coming in from the coast. First only seeing them out by seiku, then port angels, and now as far in as López island and even up here at Stuart. If left unchecked these guys could really do damage to our puget sound kelp beds.   The sea star die off several years ago meant that there is no longer a natural predator to cull out the weak or sickly urchins. We have seen the purple starfish start to make a comeback but still see almost no ragmops (sunstars). Now we are able to see sick urchins spreading throughout the patch.   Sea cucumbers have been over harvested, and the lack of restriction and or consequences for tribal fisherman fishing out of bounds or over harvesting has had a detrimental affect on both urchin and cucumber fisheries.   With increasingly bad weather it becomes harder and harder to get out ( this is more a problem with coastal diving than it is in the sound) to harvest for any fisheries.",6,3,2,2,6,3,6,3,2,3,2,3,6,3,1,3,6,3,6,3,2,3,1,"As stated before not having kelp re growing the way it should as well as a loss of starfish has affected the urchin fishery.",1,"30 years ago these fisheries were booming. Guys made big money fishing urchin and cucumber and it was ‘get all you can get’, now the quota for a state fisherman ( non tribal) is between 1000-1500 lbs per week. If the price is low, that’s barely enough to cover our expenses.   When all the urchins or cucumbers get picked the population is unable to recover. This is true of both urchin and cucumber. There is generally less of both or all species compared to 30 years ago. My partner and diver has been working the waters from southern Oregon to Alaska for 32 years and has seen this happen. Some areas recover well and if harvested correctly and sustainably can been a source of product for years to come. But there is no more ‘glory fishing’ there just aren’t numbers to support that kind of fishing any longer. Unfortunately while state fishermen are highly regulated, policed and punished for irresponsible fishing ie overhavesting, out of bounds fishing,  harvesting undersized product ect. The tribal fishermen have almost no regulation, their own tribal fish and game consistently turn a blind eye to undersized product being brought in and to over harvesting. There never seems to be any punishment to those fishermen that break the rules, not even a slap on the wrist.   This matters because often when a tribal boat comes into an area they harvest every single last urchin (or cuc) down to the tiniest babies. This leaves nothing to recover, and destroys any future harvest in that area. They also fish  frequently in out of bounds or reserve areas, for instance south of limekiln lighthouse in San Juan, or in San Juan channel on UW property coastline. These areas are left untouched for the sake of future urchins and cucumbers and for the sake of all the species there and need to be left untouched. No normal state agencies can touch tribal boats so they are again left to do as they please, even if we as state fishermen call them in.   I mention this because it is greatly affecting the way that both the urchin and cucumber fisheries are headed. Having only one part of the fishing community heavily regulated will not work, not to mention it increases feelings of resentment and anger between the two groups of fishermen.   As I mentioned before the decrease in kelp and lack of ragmops also have affected the urchin fishery.   For cucumbers, human over harvesting is the biggest problem however they are also a more mysterious species.   Two years ago the tribal fishermen over harvested around 200,000 pounds of cucs. Basically doubling their allotted quota. We were told That this meant that they would be shut down for the next year. Not even a month later and all tribal boats were out in full force harvesting cucs. Does this seem like any way to sustain the fishery to anyone?  Overall from what i see, with out further regulation and adaptation to changes in the environment none of the fisheries that i am so proud to be apart of are going to survive. If that’s not dramatically different from 30 years ago I don’t know what is.",1,"Cucumber fishing for state fishermen has been pushed back to later in the year in an effort to allow the cucs to reproduce before harvest. This would make more of a difference if you didn’t see tribal boats out harvesting all year long.","All of them.","I’m sure that there are, but I cannot say wether or not that is a good thing.

Most people ascribe the 2014-2015 ocean heat wave (popularly called the blob) to climate changes. That heat wave hurt salmon populations across the North Pacific.     Salmon migration patters seems to be atypical compared to the late 1990s. Chinook Salmon bound for the Columbia River do not seem to be migrating in shallow water (20 fathoms) along central Washington like they have done in the past. Chinook have mostly been found near the US-Canada border in 50 fathoms of water or deeper in recent years.     Albacore tuna (abundance) do not seem to have been as affected as salmon. Their coastal arrival timing and distribution do not seem any more variable than in the past.",6,3,1,2,6,3,6,3,6,3,1,3,6,3,1,3,6,3,6,3,NA,NA,1,"Salmon are affected by other species because everything lives within the California Current Ecosystem. Specifically, salmon seem to be dependent on copepod, both abundance and sub specie of copepod. Warmer waters adversely affect the populations of the good fat copepod, and promote skinny copepod. This has been identified as a major influence on salmon populations.    I also observe that avian predators, in particular double crested cormorants and Caspian terns negatively affect salmon originating in the Columbia Basin. Likewise California Sealions have increased in numbers by roughly a factor of 10 since the 1970s. They have increased their predation on salmon simply because there are more of them. As climate change affects the ecosystem the sea lions will be forced to concentrate on whatever prey is available. Because salmon are supported by hatcheries, as opposed to completely self sustaining species like CPS of Groundfish, there will likely continue to be salmon in some concentration greater than the self sustaining species. This leads to a scenario where the hatchery system simply feeds sealions and does nothing for humans.     Decreases in other species, whether de to climate change or other reasons, causes effort shift between species. For instance, if crab are down, people will try to fish salmon and tuna instead. If ground fish species are down, the drags that have crab permits will stay in the crab fishery longer in a given year.",2,NA,2,NA,"salmon and crab, but it is likely that no species will escape effects of climate change. In particular, ocean pH changes have the potential to affect all harvest species.","we don't fish jellyfish yet, but with much lower ocean pH, that's all that will be left.",3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,2,3,3,1,3,3,2,2,2,3,2,3,2,2,1,2,3,3,2,3,3,3,1,3,2,2,3,1,3,3,2,1,5,5,5,1,4,1,4,3,2,5,5,1,2,5,4,4,4,5,5,5,4,5,5,3,4,5,5,4,5,4,4,4,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,2,4,2,1,2,3,3,2,4,3,2,"In salmon, run forecasts have been hard to get right in the past. As climate change creates conditions far from the base periods used to create forecast models, forecasts can get worse. For instance the Sacramento Fall Chinook Forecast has been higher than actual returns by significant amounts in the recent past, leading to Sacramento Fall Chinook (and Klamath River Fall Chinook) being declared Overfished.     Changes to the forecast models will not be able to keep up with rapidly changing environmental conditions because of the length of time required to gather data on the response to climatic changes of salmon from various basins. Climate change is happening to rapidly for the models to keep up.     Salmon seasons are set on pre season forecasts and not modified based on in-season revised forecasts. It is appealing to try to develop in-season revision processes, but that would be very problematic because of the need to allocate to Treaty Tribal fisheries that have legally obligated allocations that may not be met if in-season modification are implemented incorrectly.     I can't think of any other management policy changes that could make the salmon fishery easier to participate in. Because the west coast salmon fishery has the ability to have conference calls, in-season modifications within pre season quotas can be accomplished on a weekly basis, it is already the quickest reacting management within PFMC.","As the California Current Ecosystem is affected by climate change, various species could become very depleted. There are NGOs outside of the community of stakeholders that will sue NMFS to take punitive action against the fisheries. Currently that is happening to the salmon fishery as a consequence of a suit over the Southern Resident Killer Whale and their perceived need to consume chinook salmon. Similarly the Dungeness crab fishery is being sued over Grey Whale entanglements. Climate change in the oceans responsible for the status of both Grey Whales and SRKW are not being addressed while the fisheries are being reduced. This will likely continue even as fisheries become highly reduced.     Sea level rises will destroy coastal infrastructure. Vast sums of money will be spent by governments trying to adapt to these changes. Without substantial lobbying by the fishing and maritime industrial sector, there will be little of no thought given to adaptions for fishing infrastructure like unloading, ice, storage and processing facilities, roads adjacent to the ocean...","Joel  Kawahara","joelkaw@earthlink.net",1,4893.833,13,NA,11,NA,5,6,"02/09/2020 19:44",NA,NA,NA,0,"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_3) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/12.0.3 Safari/605.1.15","..","/survey/selfserve/5d8/191103?sampid=103674&pin=HHIO&mail=1","wvx5ma0vwxvm86we",1,103674

I have always felt that in season actions have been acceptable.","Climate changes may be happening, but as I have sat and waited for 15 years owning a restaurant at the waters edge, we NEVER observed any rise.  The summer water temps are in the high 40's to low 50' in the salmon water, and in the lower 60's in the tuna water.  There has always been nice Salmon water along the coast, and warmer clear blue tuna water outside the 125 line.  Salmon landings have primarily been impacted by river conditions, and maybe the overharvest of baitfishes.  Maybe overabundance of bycatch in outside waters on their annual cycle.  Overall the crab landings have been consistent, the albacore seems in a decline lately, and Salmon is anyones guess.  But seriously I have not observed any level rises, or warmer than usual patterns.  The fishes we land are very healthy fishes, and the crab are very nice healthy crab.  The community is just a community.  I see no issues in that regard.","Patrick Roelle","patrick@fishpatrick.com",1,2169.861,4,NA,10,NA,5,6,"03/07/2020 13:42",NA,NA,NA,0,"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/80.0.3987.132 Safari/537.36","..","/survey/selfserve/5d8/191103?sampid=999999&pin=2020&mail=2","28cdczmx83wgh5w8",2,999999

Generally sounding like a good idea these bills are passed and give voter backing to the bills author even though the author has no idea what the effects will be on the fishing communities or the environment. It just sounded good.     California just went through the MLPAI process and addressed mandated laws to protect our marine resources. Adding layers and layers of  protections  to satisfy a special interest group to gain political popularity is a serious concern to me.     Another concern I have is limited entry. Unless provisions are put in place that limit the size of quota an individual can own we face total  owning  of a  harvestable resource by a few.     Also, international participation in limited entry programs should be illegal.     Fishermen must not have their hands tied by useless regulations.

The process of changing commercial fishing regulations needs to become more streamlined and flexible with less red tape. We need to be able to adjust regulations to suit changing conditions and we need the funding and commitment from the state to manage fisheries on a finer scale. One of my fisheries, the nearshore fishery, is supposed to be the poster child of regional management, but it is not managed regionally at all in my opinion. the quota is the same for all regions when the fish caught and health of the marine ecosystem varies significantly between regions. the sea urchin fishery needs to be able to be able to adjust regulations quickly to adapt to changes in ocean temperature and kelp abundance.
