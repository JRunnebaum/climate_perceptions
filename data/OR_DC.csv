Overall the crab landings have been consistent, the albacore seems in a decline lately, and Salmon is anyones guess.

Extreme summer temps in streams, lack of chemical signals from streams, and increased winter river flows all could negatively effect salmon.

I feel much of the regulation takes a conservative over regulation approach instead of working with real time conditions and data. I have felt a very minimal bipartisan effort when it comes to fishermen and the scientific community. For example, as someone with an education in ocean sciences, I found it even more difficult to be accepted back into the sciences after I had made a living in the fishing industry. The mistrust is high on both sides and I feel management plans are often put into effect with out compromise. I have watched too many closures due to minimal amount of testing or willingness to form a supportive management plans on the part of the scientific community. Fishermen work almost every single day and face constant struggles, they can be used as an asset, not just a tarnish on scientific bias. More data means more information, so the scientist in me says, sample more and do more habitat restoration, but the fishermen in me says...stop making us pay for your required observers. If fishermen know one language, its Money. Stop taking our futures out of our pockets on every permit, closure, fisheries observer, requirement on gear, tickets...etc",No thank you,Maia Grodin,maiagrodin@gmail.com,1,3526.275,13,NA,12,NA,5,6,5/2/2020 14:18,NA,NA,NA,0,Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.11; rv:75.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/75.0,..,/survey/selfserve/5d8/191103?sampid=999999&pin=2020&mail=2,vb4kevpya4bhyh1r,2,999999,Oregon,OR
