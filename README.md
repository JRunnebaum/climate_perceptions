# climate_perceptions

Changes to the Gulf of Maine and Southern New England Ecosystems have the potential to impact fisheries and disrupt fishing communities, in addition to the current changes the fishing industry is experiencing as a result of COVID-19. We are seeing firsthand how changes in the fishing industry can increase stress on individuals and reduce community resilience. In order to address these issues from a climate context, we are asking for your perceptions of the vulnerabilities of coastal fisheries and fishing communities, and the strengths and resilience that help them adapt to change. The findings from this project will be shared with State agencies and decision-making bodies to help inform how fishermen are thinking and adapting to changing ocean conditions.

Funding for this work is provided by The Nature Conservancy in Maine. If you would like more information on the survey you can contact Jocelyn Runnebaum at jocelyn.runnebaum@tnc.org or Laura Nelson lknelson@uw.edu.
