#This is a preliminary exploration of responses by fishery type. I want to explore relationships between demographics and beliefs about climate change using crosstabulations. "Survey Reseach and Analysis" by Vaske, Ch 13 has been helpful so far is understanding the best way to approach this. This website on how to do crosstabulations in R using dplyr is also helpful: http://analyticswithr.com/contingencytables.html
