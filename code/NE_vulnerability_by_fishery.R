##Run the vulnerability code in order to have the numbers needed below


### Example 1: subset by a fishery

#index essentially placeholder
#change q1r2 for whatever fishery you want to look at
index <- responses %>% 
  filter(lobster == 1)
index = which(responses$lobster == 1) #q1r2 is fishing for lobster
# if you changed column names, used the appropriate column name
dungycrab = survey[index,]


### Example 2: or make a new column and specify fishery(ies) for each person
# this will be better for averaging across a fishery

responses$listoffisheries = rep(NA, length =  nrow(responses))
# loop through each person and get what they are fishing for, put in new column
# should list each fishery they fish for
# not beautiful code but works
