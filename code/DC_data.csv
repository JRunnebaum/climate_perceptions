Seals and Sea Lions have no way of being managed and are growing at a rapid pace. People are quick to blame climate change and habitat loss when we have failed to keep the predators in check. Look at current populations of the predators and compare them to the 70's and you'll see where the real problem lies. Then same is happening with Deer and Elk populations as we have no way to control cougar/bear populations with the loss of hound hunting and wolves are spreading like wildfire with no way to keep their numbers in check. WA is being run on emotions and not based on humans being part of the chain of life. If we don't control the predators our fisheries and game populations will pay the ultimate price. Our biggest issue with crab right now is the tribes crabbing whenever they want and controlling the market price. It doesn't help that China will not buy our crab due to the trade war which further drives the price down as we primarily have to sell it locally. Tribes get 50% of quota and the local crabbers get whatever is left over from the recreational quota which is less and less as more people begin crabbing in the area and salmon fishing falls further downhill. Traded my crab boat this year for a permit so I can lease it out, looking to move to Idaho to get out of this state being continually mismanaged by Inslee and his liberal gang. So yeah, my wife and I brought in 567,000 this year and it is leaving the community. So yeah, it does have a negative impact when fisheries crumble but climate change is not the leading cause if any.","yes","Tribes have gotten 50% of quota. This leads to them starting to crab in June and filling half quota before we hit the water in Oct to which they have flooded the market with crab which drops the price right in time for our season opener.

We cannot crab in the summer due to recreational crabbers and so crab masses are thinned out dramatically before our opener begins.

There has always been nice Salmon water along the coast, and warmer clear blue tuna water outside the 125 line.  Salmon landings have primarily been impacted by river conditions, and maybe the overharvest of baitfishes.  Maybe overabundance of bycatch in outside waters on their annual cycle.  Overall the crab landings have been consistent, the albacore seems in a decline lately, and Salmon is anyones guess.

Tribal SMA's and delaying the start of the state season from December 1st to mid to late January has resulted in having to fish in different areas and fishing crab at different times of the season. The effort for the coastal crab fishery was usually minimal after the end of  January now the season is just getting started so we are trying to catch crab at a different time in their molt cycle and that results in having to fish different areas.","yes","As stated before it is political","Not sure","Not sure","none","none","none","none","none","somewhat","none","somewhat","never","never","never","never","never","occasionally","never","occasionally","somewhat","somewhat","somewhat","very","very","somewhat","very","occasionally","occasionally","frequently","frequently","occasionally","occasionally","frequently","none","none","none","somewhat","never","occasionally","occasionally","frequently","somewhat","none","somewhat","somewhat","occasionally","never","frequently","occasionally","somewhat_disagree","somewhat_disagree","somewhat_disagree","strongly_disagree","somewhat_disagree","neutral","strongly_disagree","somewhat_agree","strongly_disagree","somewhat_agree","neutral","neutral","strongly_disagree","somewhat_disagree","strongly_disagree","0.75","0.25","0.25","0.75","0.75","0.25","0.25","0.25","0.25","somewhat_disagree","strongly_agree","somewhat_agree","somewhat_agree","strongly_agree","strongly_agree","somewhat_agree","somewhat_agree","strongly_agree","somewhat_agree","somewhat_agree","neutral","somewhat_disagree","somewhat_disagree","neutral","strongly_agree","strongly_agree",0.75,0.25,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.75,1,0.75,0.25,"I have no idea","No","Greg Dickison","Fish2live@frontier.com",1,3494.693,14,NA,10,NA,1,2,"04/01/2020 11:03",NA,NA,NA,0,"Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 8.0.0; SAMSUNG-SM-G891A) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/80.0.3987.149 Mobile Safari/537.36","sa","/survey/selfserve/5d8/191103?sampid=999999&pin=2020&mail=2","fznnjdyufy0sbre5",2,999999,"Washington","WA",0.5,0.416666666666667,0.666666666666667,0.916666666666667,0.25,0.650854139658888,0.333333333333333,0.731247032282677

I feel much of the regulation takes a conservative over regulation approach instead of working with real time conditions and data.

For example, as someone with an education in ocean sciences, I found it even more difficult to be accepted back into the sciences after I had made a living in the fishing industry. The mistrust is high on both sides and I feel management plans are often put into effect with out compromise. I have watched too many closures due to minimal amount of testing or willingness to form a supportive management plans on the part of the scientific community. Fishermen work almost every single day and face constant struggles, they can be used as an asset, not just a tarnish on scientific bias.

Note:     Because of this delay smaller crabbers were unable to take advantage of the typically calmer weather window in the Mid November opening.  When the season did open the weather was bad and only larger crab vessels were able to set gear, claim geography, and make several pulls before smaller vessels could get out.     This had a significant effect on smaller vessel income given that the first few days provide much of the income for crabbers.","I would like to point out my concern about regulations becoming a political measuring tool. It seems that up and coming politicians are bombarded by NGOs to provide  protection  to the deteriorating oceans Their words not mine.     So bills are authored and sponsored and submitted etc. with little or no verified scientific basis, stakeholder participation or public comment.      Generally sounding like a good idea these bills are passed and give voter backing to the bills author even though the author has no idea what the effects will be on the fishing communities or the environment. It just sounded good.     California just went through the MLPAI process and addressed mandated laws to protect our marine resources. Adding layers and layers of  protections  to satisfy a special interest group to gain political popularity is a serious concern to me.     Another concern I have is limited entry. Unless provisions are put in place that limit the size of quota an individual can own we face total  owning  of a  harvestable resource by a few.     Also, international participation in limited entry programs should be illegal.     Fishermen must not have their hands tied by useless regulations.
